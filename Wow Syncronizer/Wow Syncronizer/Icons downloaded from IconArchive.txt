Sir Thomas (better known as the Headless Horseman) was once a Knight of the Silver Hand 
and hero among his fellow paladins. He became cursed, driven insane within the Scarlet Monastery, 
and believed that he was alive and that everyone alive was dead. 
His fervor no longer served the Light. 
With the coming of Hallow's End, he spreads gloom and fire across the villages of Azeroth.
He appears in his true but ghostly form after his headless form is defeated.
